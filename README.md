# E-commerce Website

### What It Is

This project is a logistics order management system for an e-commerce website.

### Building the Website

The website is built using the following technologies:

Front-End: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Deployment: GitHub Pages with custom DNS
Backend: Powered by Bmob Cloud (a cloud-based SQL database service)

### Why It Matters

This project originated from a university e-commerce experiment class where it received a perfect score. 
This success fueled my passion for computer science and ultimately led me to pursue a career in web development.
